I am a computer engineering student at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute. I am passionate about learning about the latest technologies and using them to solve real-world problems. I am also a strong problem-solver and have a knack for finding creative solutions.
I am excited to contribute to the open-source project JdeRobot this summer by dockerizing Visual Circuit.

In my spare time, I enjoy watching Open mics, playing video games, and spending time with my friends and family.
